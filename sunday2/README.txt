In order to compile the program, the files can be imported into Eclipse.
Unfortunately we were unable to submit an executable because of numerous issues with 
implementing a second GUI.

1. Create a new Eclipse Java Project.
2. Right click "src" inside the project and 'Import...' 
3. Locate folder contatining all files (including images) and import.
4. Open Game.java and choose 'Run -> Run As -> Java Application'.
5. Use the command line to enter name, number of tiles etc.
6. The main window will open displaying a board of specified tiles, mine, and also the timer and counters.
